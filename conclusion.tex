\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Summary}
During the course of this program, I worked on the implementation, architectural design, and verification of an LPDDR4X memory controller. 

Our goal was to create a generator that can be integrated into Chipyard and used in future chip designs and research. 

During our development phase, we tested the functionality of units and verified our logic. In addition, we have a simulation-based test harness where we exercise the end-to-end system as a whole.

\section{Future Work}
Optimizations of the architecture and micro-architecture of the controller, formal verification, and a more robust test harness are some of the future work for this project. I will keep contributing to the project whenever possible and will mainly focus on a complete software model for this design.

The implementation will be taped-out in the near future and will be brought up as a design under a test environment for the purpose of post-silicon validation. We completed our mission of a complete generator for LPDDR4X. However, there will be extended research on optimizing the controller architecture, PHY design, and PCB design mainly by Ken Ho and other graduate students.
